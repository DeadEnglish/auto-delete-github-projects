# Auto delete project button

A simple UserScript to add an auto delete button for a project. You'll still have to check you want to delete it but now you won't have to enter the name.

Look, I'm **sick** and **tired** of typing the project name and clicking confirm project removal three times. GitHub have now make it almost unbearable by removing the ability to copy paste the project name, I've had enough.
